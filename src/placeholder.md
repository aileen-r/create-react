# This is a title

Start typing here...

## Here is a subheading

### Basics

You can add some **bold** text, or _italics_, or go crazy with **_both at once_**! You can even ~~strikethrough~~.

You can also add blockquotes:

> It's dangerous to go alone. Take this üó°Ô∏è.

and even [add links](https://aileenrae.co.uk).

### Lists

#### Numbered List

1. You can add list items like this.
1. You don't even need to use sequential numbers.
1. Markdown's got you; human error is real.

#### Bulleted List

- Bulleted lists can be built with hyphens `-`

* Or asteriks `*`

- It doesn't matter which

#### Nested Lists

- A bulleted list
  1. With a numbered list inside
  - with a bulleted list inside that
  2. It's lists
  - all
    - the
      - way
        - down

### Code

#### Single-line code

`<span>A single line of code is wrapped in backticks.</span>`

#### Multi-line code

Multi-line code is wrapped in triple backticks.

````
// Multi-line code sample

function printCode(inputString) {
  return "```" + inputString + "```";
}
````

### Tables

I definitely copied and pasted this table because it was too much effort to type out but, yup, you can even type out tables:

| Wild Header      | Crazy Header    | Another Header?    |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....    |
| And here.        | Okay.           | I think we get it. |

And finally...

### Images

You can add images. Like these photos of Barkley. Look at him.
